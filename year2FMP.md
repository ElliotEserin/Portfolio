# Year 2 project - Topic: Procedural Generation.
### This section is for displaying information about my year 2 Final Major project, looking at procedural generation in Unity3D.

My repository can be found [here.](https://github.com/ElliotEserin/Procedural-Worlds) 
An executable build of the game can be found [here.](https://ellioteserin.github.io/Procedural-Generation-Build/)

## Isles of Generation. Version: 1.00 
### About the game:

Isles of Generation was a project looking at procedurally generating an open world game using concepts such as Perlin noise and A* pathfinding. It allows you to enter a seed as well as several variables to contol world size and some options for what you want to include (villages, rivers etc.) and then generates a world for you to explore.

You can then walk around and explore the ruins, villages and variety of biomes - as well as chase the animals... 
A video of gameplay can be viewed below:

This project was made over the span of 10 weeks (not including pre-production) and was a chance for us to explore a specialised topic, research and design a game and then make it. It involved scheduling, writing up a design document with references to theories, research or inspiring material. It was made between college and home and we used GitHub and SourceTree to verion control our work. 

In this project, lots of the assets were made in collaboration with an artist and the rest of the art assets and audio were sourced for free online. However I wrote all of the code for the project and only used tutorials to help me learn about things I haven't done before - such as perlin noise.
