### This is a portfolio to showcase my projects and work in Game Development.

# About me

Hi, I'm Elliot Eserin, a student at Lewes College. I have just finished my second year doing a Level 3 UAL in Software and Game Design. I want to work as a programmer/developer and I specialise in C# and Unity3D. I have several years of experience in Game Design and programming and have had the opportunity to work on both personal and group projects. I have also developed a mobile app for my college using the Flutter SDK and Dart programming language.

I also code all the time as a hobby!

I also have some experience playing and composing music, as well as some very basic artistic and 3D modeling skills. I have also experimented in other programming languages such as Dart, JavaScript, Python, and C++ as well as HTML and CSS but I mostly code in C# for personal projects. I haven't ever really developed anything more than console applications in other programming languages but I am more than eager to learn more or extend my knowledge on them.

Ever since I've learned about programming and game development I have been really in love with it - whether that was building terrible games in Scratch or writing text adventures in Python, and now making games in Unity, I have loved the problem solving and creativity that it brings and I find a lot of satisfaction out of making programs and imagining what I'll be able to do with whatever new information I have learned.
