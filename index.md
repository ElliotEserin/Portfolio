# About me

Hi, I'm Elliot Eserin, a college student at Lewes College, in my second year doing a Level 3 UAL in Software and Game Design.
I am and want to be a programmer, currently specialising in C# and Unity3D. I have several years experience in Game Design and programming and have had the opportunity to work on both personal and group projects. I also code all the time as a hobby!

I also have some experience playing and composing music - as I play the piano - as we;; as some very basic artistic and 3D modelling skills.
I have also experimented in other languages such as JavaScript, Python and C++ as well as HTML and CSS but I mostly code in C# for personal projects. I haven't ever really developed anything more than console applications in other programming languages but I am more than eager to learn more or extend my knowledge on them.
