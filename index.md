# About me

Hi, I'm Elliot Eserin, a college student at Lewes College, in my second year doing a Level 3 UAL in Software and Game Design.
I am and want to be a programmer, currently specialising in C# and Unity3D. I have several years experience in Game Design and programming and have had the opportunity to work on both personal and group projects. I also code all the time as a hobby!

I also have some experience playing and composing music - as I play the piano - as well as some very basic artistic and 3D modelling skills.
I have also experimented in other languages such as JavaScript, Python and C++ as well as HTML and CSS but I mostly code in C# for personal projects. I haven't ever really developed anything more than console applications in other programming languages but I am more than eager to learn more or extend my knowledge on them.

I really want to work as a programmer making games. I don't really have much of a preference between working in a small or large team but my dream job would be working in a group to make games!

Ever since I've learned about programming and game development I have been really in love with it - whether that was building terrible games in Scratch or writing text adventures in Python, and now making games in Unity, I have loved the problem solving and creativity that it brings and I find a lot of satisfaction out of making programs (especially ones that work!) and imagining what I'll be able to do with whatever new information I have learned.
Who needs to sleep at night when you have code to figure out...

# Skills
I would say my top skills in this field are:
- c#
- Unity
- Game Design and Development

I would also say I am good at:
- project planning
- Time management
- teamwork

which I think can be seen in the project planning and scheduling for college.

# Qualifications
I thought maybe I should list these somewhere incase they are important...
