# Final Major Project

My repository can be found [here.](https://github.com/ElliotEserin/Anthropocene-FMP-game) 
(this also includes a Windows executable build which tends to work better than the WebGL build)

### About the game:

Anthropocene is a top-down survival game where you collect resources in order to survive and create a sustainable base or ecosystem. The game was designed to have social impact and so the game is supposed to show the dangers of global warming, pollution and littering in a future, dystopian world in which humans have destroyed. 

The gallery displays a variety of images taken throughout the development of the game - ones at the top are more recent.
