<h2> Boss Rush Game Jam </h2>
This is the first game jam I have properly took part in and was a month long jam to make a boss rush game.
You can view and play the game on its itch.io page [here](https://itch.io/jam/boss-rush-jam-2021/rate/1144966)
Or you can download it below:

I had several minor setbacks, including a week holiday in which I didn't have internet (or a computer) however I still tried my best to make a finished product and I am proud of it even if its not exactly what I imagined at the beginning.
