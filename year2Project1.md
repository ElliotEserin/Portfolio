# Year 2 project - Topic: Shaders and realism.
### This section is for displaying information about my first project of year two where I look at shaders in Unity3D.

My repository can be found [here.](https://https://github.com/ElliotEserin/IncrediblySuperRealisticUnderwaterThingy) 
An executable build of the game can be found [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fzSqJGvuwZo03iZqsWkcXpnDXYdiKFez/view?usp=sharing)
Whilst I wanted to make a WebGL build like my previous project, the shaders didn't work properly and it did not work as hoped...

## AquaMarina. Version: 1.00 
### About the game:

AquaMarina is an underwater "experience" where you explore around picking up collectables. Whilst it is a very simple concept, my main goal was to look at writing shaders in HLSL (CG) and ShaderLab and explore theories on creating realistic graphics - specifically in Unity3D. 
The player also has the ablity to take photos using a virtual camera with adjustable settings as well as the ability to place bait which attracts the local wildlife.

The gallery displays a variety of images taken throughout the development of the game - showing off the graphics and visuals of the game.
There is also a gameplay video below showcasing the finished protype of the game.

This project was made over the span of 10 weeks (not including pre-production) and was a chance for us to explore a specialised topic, research and design a game and then make it. It involved scheduling, writing up a design document with references to theories, research or inspiring material. It was made between college and home and we used GitHub and SourceTree to verion control our work. 

In this project, all of the art assets and audio were sourced for free online. However I wrote all of the code for the project and - using tutorials - wrote and learned about the shaders before adapting them more to my needs.
