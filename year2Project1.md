# Year 2 project - Topic: Shaders and realism.
### This section is for displaying information about my first project of year two where I look at shaders in Unity3D.

My repository can be found [here.](https://https://github.com/ElliotEserin/IncrediblySuperRealisticUnderwaterThingy) 
An executable build of the game can be found [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fzSqJGvuwZo03iZqsWkcXpnDXYdiKFez/view?usp=sharing)
Whilst I wanted to make a WebGL build like my previous project, the shaders didn't work properly and it did not work as hoped...

## AquaMarina. Version: 1.00 

<br>
### About the game:

AquaMarina is an underwater "experience" where you explore around picking up collectables. Whilst it is a very simple concept, my main goal was to look at writing shaders in HLSL (CG) and ShaderLab and explore theories on creating realistic graphics - specifically in Unity3D. 
The player also has the ablity to take photos using a virtual camera with adjustable settings as well as the ability to place bait which attracts the local wildlife.

The gallery displays a variety of images taken throughout the development of the game - showing off the graphics and visuals of the game.
There is also a gameplay video below showcasing the finished protype of the game.
