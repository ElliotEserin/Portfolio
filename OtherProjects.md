<h2> FMP Reskin </h2>
As an ongoing project I am working with an artist to reskin my FMP from last year. I think this will be really good experience working with someone else - particularly an artist on a project. However I don't currently have anyhting to show. The repository can be found [here](https://github.com/ElliotEserin/FMP-Re-skin)

<h2> 3D TicTacToe </h2>
Along side our year 2 practical project we made TicTacToe with a twist and I decided to make a 3D physics based TicTacToe. You can play it [here](https://ellioteserin.github.io/TicTacToe3D/TicTacToe%20Build/game.html) if you are interested.

<h2> Space Invaders </h2>
I made a Christmas-themed Space Invaders as a sort of Christmas card that would be sent out to people. I worked with a classmate who did some art and I made the gameplay and music. I also implemented a global leaderboard that is a database hosted on a webserver. The game can be played [here](https://ellioteserin.github.io/Space-Invaders/) if you are interested, although it is quite basic. It was still a fun project to make and with the small amount of time I had to do it in before Christmas I think it turned out alright.
